      <h2>WHY:</h2>
      <p>We started this company because we love candles, but we wanted more fun shapes, colors and sizes of candles.
      As college students we were able to find our true love for candles during our long study stretches, and especially during our decompressing time.
      We found that calming, non-overpowering sent have a very positive reactions when helping us manage stress, we are founders wanted to pass on our saving grace to everyone but added some special personalizationâ€™s</p>

      <h2>What:</h2>
      <p> When purchasing a candle, you first pick out what sent you want. 
      Next, you pick out the wick (flat, square, cored, wooden), type you would like. After that you pick the size/shape of jar you would like the wax poured in.
      finally you will be able to pick what color you would like the wax to be.</p>
