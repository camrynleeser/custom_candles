    <p>Looking to add a customizable, warm touch to your life? You have come to the right place. We can customize almost any detail to your specific candle.
    We believe everyone should have a candle that is significant to them and is made to provide 100% satisfaction.
    These candles also make great gifts for friends and family.
    You could go to the store and pick out any old candle, but with these gifts, you are spending time crafting the gift to find something that suits the receiver best. 
    We also provide live online help if you are feeling stuck or are in need of any technical support.</p>
